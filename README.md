## Setup

- Requires VS2022.
- Unzip the "generatedFiles.zip" folder so all contents are stored in "C:\temp\generatedFiles" (or unzip anywhere you want, change the path in the application to match)
  
## Assignment

- Search the 15,001 files in generatedFiles.zip for the string stored in the _searchValue constant in program.cs; The Program.cs portion must display the names of all the files that contain this string as file content.

Note: The files found only need to be added to the _filesLocated field. The pre-written code will display that for you at the end. The number of files located should be returned by the LocateFilesContainingContent call.


## Turning the Assignment In
### Option A:
- Clone the code in this repository, and create your own personal repository to host the results.
- Once completed, email the link to your repository if it's public, or send an invite to collaborate on the repo if it's private

### Option B:
- If you do not wish to create a personal repository, email the solution as a zip file (with the ".zip" extension removed from the filename).
